0. Trojan0:
   Random encode (XOR) the key and leak its information through load wire

1. Trojan1:
   r1 signal as an outer control signal, r1 == 1 > 8 cycles then send the trigger signal (maybe to the next trojan)

2. Trojan2:
   After a certain pattern of data, force_trigger acts as a fake reset signal and send out

3. Trojan3:
   Secretly modify the data (increase 2) when finish counting

4. Trojan4:
   Leak the key directly

5. Trojan5:
   Secretly skip an instruction by incrementing the pc register by 2 under certain conditions

6. Trojan6:
   After following a specific data pattern, modify the last 2 bits of data

7. Trojan7:
   Change the slave controlled by the master program under certain input data pattern

8. Trojan8:
   With some repeated/equivalent computation logic, has potential to leak information

9. Trojan9:
   Like trojan8, through some computations, try to send wrong data out
